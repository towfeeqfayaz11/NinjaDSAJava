// sorting
// based on iterative way of sorting
# bubble sort        // used of smaller size of data array T=O(N^2), S=O(1), stable (maintains relative order of same elements)
# selection sort     // used of smaller size of data array T=O(N^2), S=O(1), not stable (does not maintain relative order of same elements)
# insertion sort     // best suited for partial sorted array T=O(N^2), S=O(1), stable (maintains relative order of same elements)

// based on recursive way of sorting
# merge sort (calling recursion first and then doing work) // needs local copies
# quick sort (does work upfront and then calls recursion) // no local copies are required

// based on trees
# heap sort
