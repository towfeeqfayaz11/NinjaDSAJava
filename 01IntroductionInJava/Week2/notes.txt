# in case of characters in java when we try to perform an operation(arithmatic operation), the actual operation happens
  on the ascii values and hence the result is an integer literal

# automatic / implicit type conversion/casting takes place when two types are compatible and the size of the destination type
  is larger than the source type

# Operations on Strings and char
  + ==> concatinates two strings

  string + string = string
  string  + number = string
