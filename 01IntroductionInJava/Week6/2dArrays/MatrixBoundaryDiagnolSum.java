Problem statement
You are given a two-dimensional square matrix of size NÃ—N. You need to find the sum of the elements on:

The main diagonal (from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner).
The secondary diagonal (from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner).
All the boundary elements of the matrix
Make sure that no element is counted more than once, even if it belongs to both diagonals or is a boundary element. Your task is to compute the sum of all these unique elements.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^3
Time Limit: 1sec
Sample input 1:
1
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Sample Output 1:
45
Explanation for Sample Output 1:
The boundary elements are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7 and 4. 

The first-diagonal elements are 1, 5 and 9. 

The second-diagonal elements are 3, 5 and 7.

We just need to add all these numbers making sure that no number is added twice. For example, '1' is both a boundary element and a first-diagonal element similarly, '5' contributes to both the diagonals but they won't be added twice.

Hence, we add up, [1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 5] to give 45 as the output.
